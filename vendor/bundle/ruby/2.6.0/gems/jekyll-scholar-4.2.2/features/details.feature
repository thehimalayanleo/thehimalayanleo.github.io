Feature: Details
  As a scholar who likes to blog
  I want to publish my BibTeX bibliography on my blog
  And I want Jekyll to generate detail pages for all the entries in my bibliography

  @generators
  Scenario: A bibliography with a single entry
    Given I have a scholar configuration with:
      | key            | value             |
      | source         | ./_bibliography   |
      | details_layout | details.html      |
    And I have a "_bibliography" directory
    And I have a file "_bibliography/references.bib":
      """
      @book{ruby,
        title     = {The Ruby Programming Language},
        author    = {Flanagan, David and Matsumoto, Yukihiro},

    When I run jekyll
    Then the _site directory should exist
    And the "_site/bibliography/ruby.html" file should exist
    And I should see "The Ruby Programming Language" in "_site/bibliography/ruby.html"
