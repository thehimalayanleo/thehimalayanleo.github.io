Hello! I am Ajinkya Mulay, a <del>second</del> <del>third</del> fourth year PhD student at Purdue University. I am pursuing my Ph.D. under the guidance of Prof. Xiaojun Lin in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. My primary research area is designing algorithms in Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning.

Please find the list of my publications under [the research page](/research/) and my CV under [the CV page](/CV/).

## Updates: ##

* Nov 2021: We discuss recent progress in graphing multivariate <em>statistical</em> power manifolds with novel Machine Learning at the [MCP Colloquium](https://www.purdue.edu/hhs/psy/colloquia/index.html) at Purdue University. Work done with the SuperPower group. Slides and paper incoming soon.

* June 2021: Our article <em>[Towards Quantifying the Carbon Emissions of Differentially Private Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06946)</em> was accepted at the ICML Workshop on Socially Responsible Machine Learning. 

* May 2021: Started internship as PhD SWE at Facebook, Menlo Park.

* Feb 2021: Started a new blog on differential privacy and federated learning along with my journey in my PhD.

* Feb 2021: Added a new blog post for workflows in Machine Learning Systems at [ML Workflows for Research Scientists](https://thehimalayanleo.github.io/MLForResearchScientists/). Published in Editor's Picks on *[Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/)* publication (at [link](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-workflow-for-research-scientists-fb582538aac1)). 

* Jan 2021: Promoted to Machine Learning Team Lead in the SuperPower research group.

* Nov 2020: Our article <em>FedPerf: A Practitioners' Guide to Performance of Federated Learning Algorithms</em>, got accepted to NIPS 2020 Preregistration Workshop. We were amongst the 8 papers invited for a contributed talk for the workshop. Further open-source updates coming soon!

* Oct 2020: Submitted research article <em>FedPerf: A Practitioners' Guide to Performance of Federated Learning Algorithms</em> to NIPS 2020 Preregistration Workshop.

* Aug 2020: Joined SuperPower Team (PIs: Dr. Erin Hennes and Dr. Sean Lane) as a Graduate Research Assistant, designing automated and <em>smart</em> algorithms for parameter space exploration using Machine Learning Techniques.

* April 2020: Joined OpenMined as a Research Scientist.

* Feb 2020: Published my first blog. 

* Aug 2019: Started the website. My research paper <em>DFC: Dynamic UL-DL Frame Configuration Mechanism for Improving Channel Access in eLAA</em>, (at NeWS Lab at IIT Hyderabad), got published in IEEE Networking Letters.
