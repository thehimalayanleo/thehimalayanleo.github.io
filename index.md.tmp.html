<p>Hello! I am Ajinkya Mulay, a <del>second</del> <del>third</del> fourth year PhD student at Purdue University. I am pursuing my Ph.D. under the guidance of Prof. Xiaojun Lin in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. My primary research area is designing algorithms in Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning.</p>

<p>Please find the list of my publications under <a href="file:///Users/ajinkya/github-repos/thehimalayanleo.github.io/research">the research page</a> and my CV under <a href="file:///Users/ajinkya/github-repos/thehimalayanleo.github.io/cv">the CV page</a>. If you're curious about my other software projects check out the <a href="file:///Users/ajinkya/github-repos/thehimalayanleo.github.io/curious"><em>curious page</em></a>.</p>
