I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. (second year) in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Purdue University (with Xiaojun Lin and Nicolo Michelusi as my advisors). I am interested in Machine Learning (privacy and security) and Wireless Communications. Previously, I have interned at the Esaki Lab in the University of Tokyo (with Hideya Ochiai and Hiroshi Esaki) and at the Networked Wireless Systems (NeWS) Laboratory in IIT Hyderabad (with Bheemarjuna Reddy and Antony Franklin).

In 2014 I graduated from IIT Hyderabad with my Electrical engineering bachelors (with Honors) degree. In my free time I blog, climb mountains and read books.

## Research Focus : A quick description

As we go on collecting data for machine learning applications, we need to ensure that strong privacy schemes are enforced. Differential Privacy allows any data accessing mechanism to protect the privacy of either a single data point, an individual and even a small group (generally) by adding enough noise to camoflauge their precense. However, modern machine learning uses stochastic gradient descent to converge to an optimal point and with the addition of (large) noise, it may not converge at all. My research is all about designing privacy-first schemes to ensure we learn global information while preserving local privacy. 

Over time I will be including precise mathematical definitions and results about Differential Privacy on my blog page.
