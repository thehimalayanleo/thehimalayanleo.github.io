I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. (second year) in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Purdue University (with Xiaojun Lin and Nicolo Michelusi as my advisors). I am interested in Machine Learning (privacy and security) and Wireless Communications. More specifically, I work on designing private algorihtms using Differential Privacy. 

I have been a Graduate Teaching Assistant in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Purdue and work closely with the professors and students in preparing course material, providing supplementary teaching and hosting office hours. Currently, I am involved in teaching the ECE20002 (Engineering Fundamental 2) course which involves MOSFETS, circuit transforms and op-amps. Previously, I have handled lab sessions for ECE270 (Introduction to Digital System Design) which is the introdcutory course in handling breadboards and Verilog to code CPLDs.

In 2014 I graduated from IIT Hyderabad with my Electrical engineering bachelors (with Honors) degree. In my free time I blog, read self-help books and practice bouldering. Previously, I have interned at the Esaki Lab in the University of Tokyo (with Prof. Hideya Ochiai and Prof. Hiroshi Esaki) and at the Networked Wireless Systems (NeWS) Laboratory in IIT Hyderabad (with Bheemarjuna Reddy and Antony Franklin). 

## Research Focus : A quick description

As we go on collecting data for machine learning applications, we need to ensure that strong privacy schemes are enforced. Differential Privacy allows any data accessing mechanism to protect the privacy of either a single data point, an individual and even a small group (generally) by adding enough noise to camoflauge their precense. However, modern machine learning uses stochastic gradient descent to converge to an optimal point and with the addition of (large) noise, it may not converge at all. My research is all about designing privacy-first schemes to ensure we learn global information while preserving local privacy. 

Over time I will be including precise mathematical definitions and results about Differential Privacy on my blog page.
