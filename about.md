I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. (second year) in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Purdue University (with Xiaojun Lin and Nicolo Michelusi as my advisors). I am interested in Machine Learning (privacy and security) and Wireless Communications. Previously, I have interned at the Esaki Lab in the University of Tokyo (with Hideya Ochiai and Hiroshi Esaki) and at the Networked Wireless Systems (NeWS) Laboratory in IIT Hyderabad (with Bheemarjuna Reddy and Antony Franklin).

In 2014 I graduated from IIT Hyderabad with my Electrical engineering bachelors (with Honors) degree. My personal leisure activities include hiking, cycling, soccer and participating in adventure races.
