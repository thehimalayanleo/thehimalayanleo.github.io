* **SuperPower Project**: Designing algorithms to examine effects of parameter uncertainty on statistical power and identify regions of robustness/reactivity in specified parameter values over a high‑dimensional parameter space. Research article detailing our approaches incoming soon. Some more information found here [SuperPower](https://henneslab.wixsite.com/scsj/blank-4)

* **FedPerf**: Developing methods to characterize Private Federated Learning Systems and identify and track the performance of Federated Algorithms over varied environments with a single easy‑to‑use metric. Development and open-source deployment underway. Original Proposal found here [Manuscript Link](https://preregister.science/papers_20neurips/76_paper.pdf)
