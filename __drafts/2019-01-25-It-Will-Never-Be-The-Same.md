We sometimes have this magical feeling. It ignites something so new and pure inside us, something that makes us feel amazing in every moment.

Over time, our intial rush subsides and even though we still do feel happy, it does not compare to our initial reaction. Ofcourse, such a change in emotion is to be expected. However, sometimes we stay in the situation for too long and it can be unclear whether we are still here because of the hope that things might improve or because we really like being in the situation.
