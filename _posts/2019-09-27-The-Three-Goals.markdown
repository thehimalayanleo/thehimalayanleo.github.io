After reading quite a lot of self-help books, I have come to personally believe that having a great, grand goal (GGG) is amazing, but rarely achievable. I am sure that most of you can relate with such a statement. However, I am not saying that the GGG is not achievable, but instead there is a different approach to it. Let's say you want to build a LEGO house. Even though you know you want to build the entire house, while constructing it will you just start building arbitarily? Until a house is built. I am guessing for the major bulk of the people out there, you will start by designing a small portion of the house, for example its garage. Then, you will go even smaller and just design the garage door and so on, until you finish you first part of the house. 

What does that small part do? It not only contributes to the house completion, but also gives you an experience of the challenges lying ahead and builds your confidence. That is how we learn most things in life too! We start by learning the alphabet, then some random words, then a few incoherent sentences, go onto learn some context and boom! We can now converse with people and share with other anything we want. So, if one of the greatest invention of humankind can be harnessed by breaking it down into small achievable goals, why not breakdown our GGG as well?

Just like you I have had my fair share of GGGs over time. I achieved a few, but as we grow up we find even better GGG and we believe each one of them can change our life for the better. So, I have decided to take it up as a challenge to achieve just 3 GGGs by the end of this year. I have written this post on the morning of September 27th, 2019 and I wish to achieve my GGGs in research, coding and health.

The GGGs are:
1.
2.
3.

To keep a track of my progress and see how week-by-week goals are useful, I will create objective (with some subjectivity, duhh!, I am human after all) goals for each of the 52 weeks. I want to see if I can achieve them in or under an year.
