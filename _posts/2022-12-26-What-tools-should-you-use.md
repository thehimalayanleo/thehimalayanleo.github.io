This is an ever-updating list of tools that I am currently using or experimenting with. Almost all of them are free or open-source. None of these links are affiliate-links.

- **Obsidian:** Alternatives are LogSeq and RemNote. Obsidian is very cool with a canvas and connected notes. Consider paying for their in-built sync which is way better than iCloud sync (and even has an academic discount!. [Link](https://obsidian.md/).
- **Capacities:** Amazing for academic notes. Mobile app is under development. [Link](https://capacities.io/).
- **You.com:** Love this search engine on desktop, has a built in chat-bot with referencing and collects data from multiple search engines. Perfect for searching arxiv.com. Mobile app is developing too. [Link](https://you.com/). Try their study link for finding good research articles at [Link](https://you.com/).
- **Arc Browser:** I use both Chrome and Arc and they work so fluently together too! Would definitely recommend Arc for focussed work. Coming up with a Windows and mobile app soon. [Link](https://arc.net/).
- **Raindrop:**  My favorite bookmarks manager that works well with Chrome, Arc and Safari. Easiest to work with pdfs. [Link](https://raindrop.io/).
- **Todoist:** Easiest to manage tasks with Todoist. Use a Kanban board with three headers- *In Progress, Completed and Somday*. [Link](https://todoist.com/).
- **Sublime Text:** Fastest editor for quick writing, scripting and base coding. [Link](https://www.sublimetext.com/).
- **PDF Expert:** Perfect themes and a simple PDF editor and reader on mobile and desktop. This one is one of the only few paid tools on the list but totally worth it. Again has an academic discount. [Link](https://pdfexpert.com/).
- **Warp:** Love the command line tool with easy copying-pasting and auto-complete. Has a ton of themes and extensions and is fully free. [Link](https://www.warp.dev/).
- **Raycast:** Cannot recommend this tool enough. It will replace at least 10-12 different tools for you including Alfred, Spotlight, Calculators, File Search, building extensions, storing copied text, internet speed test, quick google meet and so much more! [Link](https://www.raycast.com/).
- **Spark:** Works really well with mobile and desktop emailing and allows for Office 365 and gmail. Just plug it in once and use it forever. One caveat, requires server syncing and emails might not be as private. [Link](https://sparkmailapp.com/).
- **Fantastical:** Again a plug-and-play app for all my calendar needs. Pay for their academic discounted yearly plan and forget about forgetting events! [Link](https://flexibits.com/fantastical).
- **Sleeve:** Not a required app but pretty fun for switching music with a floating widget on MacOS. Works well with Spotify and Apple Music. [Link](https://replay.software/sleeve).
- **NordVPN:** They always have amazing deals and can be used on mobile and desktop. Again paid, but simple plug-and-play. [Link](https://nordvpn.com/).
