This is an ever-updating list of tools that I am currently using or experimenting with. Almost all of them are free or open-source. None of these links are affiliate links.

- **Obsidian:** Alternatives are LogSeq and RemNote. Obsidian is very cool with a canvas and connected notes. Consider paying for their in-built sync which is way better than iCloud sync (and even has an academic discount!) [Link](https://obsidian.md/).
- **Arc Browser:** I use both <s>Chrome</s> Safari and Arc and they work so fluently together too! Would definitely recommend Arc for focussed work. Launching a Windows app soon. The mobile app is not too great yet but provides basic sync. [Link](https://arc.net/).
- **Raindrop:**  My favorite bookmarks manager that works well with Chrome, Arc, and Safari. Easiest to store PDFs, especially research papers. [Link](https://raindrop.io/).
- **Perplexity:** Perfect replacement for You.com. Helps find interesting research papers. [Link](pplx.ai)
- **Apple Reminders:** Built-in with the Mac and syncs seamlessly with other apps. With the new update, I can easily make Kanban boards right in the Reminders app.
- **Tweek:** A simple app that allows you to input per-day tasks only. Very basic functionality but its simplicity is probably the best feature. Quite similar to a handwritten planner. I use it hand-in-hand with Apple Reminders. Tweek's week/month view is just much more convenient. Completely free except for some pro features. [Link](https://tweek.so/),
- **Cot Editor:** A beautiful editor that easily replaces Sublime Text. [Link](https://coteditor.com/)
- **PDF Expert:** Perfect dark themes and a simple PDF editor and reader on mobile and desktop. This one is one of the only few paid tools on the list but totally worth it (can be used free as well!). Has an academic discount. [Link](https://pdfexpert.com/).
- **Warp:** Love the command line tool with easy copying-pasting and auto-complete. Has a ton of themes and extensions and is fully free. [Link](https://www.warp.dev/).
- **Raycast:** Cannot recommend this tool enough. It will replace at least 10-12 different tools for you including Alfred, Spotlight, Calculators, File Search, building extensions, storing copied text, internet speed test, quick Google Meet and so much more! [Link](https://www.raycast.com/).
- **Spark:** Works really well with mobile and desktop emailing and allows for Office 365 and Gmail. Just plug it in once and use it forever. One caveat, requires server syncing and emails might not be as private. [Link](https://sparkmailapp.com/).
- **Fantastical:** Again a plug-and-play app for all my calendar needs. Pay for their academic discounted yearly plan and forget about forgetting events! [Link](https://flexibits.com/fantastical).
- **NordVPN:** They always have amazing deals and can be used on mobile and desktop. Again paid, but simple plug-and-play. [Link](https://nordvpn.com/).

## Tools that I do not use anymore:

- **Capacities:** Amazing for academic notes. The mobile app is <s>under development</s> now released (only available for paid users). I switched to Obsidian due to its integrations and its speed on both mobile and desktop. [Link](https://capacities.io/).
- **You.com:** Love this search engine on desktop, has a built-in chatbot with referencing, and collects data from multiple search engines. Perfect for searching arxiv.com. The mobile app is developing too. Perplexity's interface and abilities seem a lot better, so I switched! [Link](https://you.com/). 
- **Sublime Text:** Fastest editor for quick writing, scripting, and base coding. CotEditor is much more stable and fast. [Link](https://www.sublimetext.com/).
- **Todoist:** Easiest to manage tasks with Todoist. Use a Kanban board with three headers- *In Progress, Completed and Somday*. Apple Reminders now has the Kanban board and better speed. [Link](https://todoist.com/).
- **Sleeve:** Not a required app but pretty fun for switching music with a floating widget on MacOS. Works well with Spotify and Apple Music. Unfortunately, it does not support YouTube music! [Link](https://replay.software/sleeve).
