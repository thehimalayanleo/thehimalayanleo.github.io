Understanding privacy involves knowing the fundamentals of differential privacy and federated learning systems. There seems to be quite a lot of interest in the theory of privacy as well as knowing how to exactly deploy these systems. This first primer in a long series of posts will provide the basics to get started with the theoretical foundations, basic implementations (open-source) and how to deploy it in research and industry. I'll host these on GitHub (hosted at [A Primer on Differential Privacy](https://github.com/thehimalayanleo/APrimerOnDifferentialPrivacy)) along with a compiled list of relevant resources.
