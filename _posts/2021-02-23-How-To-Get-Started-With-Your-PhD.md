I joined the Electrical and Computer Engineering PhD Program at Purdue in Fall of 2018. When I begun my PhD, I was unsure of the research area I wanted to focus on, what I envisioned doing in the future and did not even know my PhD Advisor. On this journey (in my third year now), I have learnt a lot! Right from getting started with new research, how to read papers, how to write well, improve your social presence, collaborate, get internships and most importantly- how to follow your passion! Follow along as I take you on a journey of my experience and hopefully you find important resources and tips for your PhD journey!
